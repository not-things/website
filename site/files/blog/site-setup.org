* Webhost
I use [[https://nearlyfreespeech.net][NearlyFreeSpeech]] as my website host. Their non-production site pricing is very cheap (base cost of 0.01 USD per day). If I was just hosting static content though, I'd probably use Github pages.

* Publishing
Most of my website is written with Emac's ~org-mode~ and then exported using the built-in HTML export functionality. There are a few pages where it's difficult to write with just the functionality that org-mode provides (mostly dynamic pages) and so I write them in HTML/JS/PHP.

* Version Control
I host the source code of the website on my [[https://github.com/not-things/website/][Github]].
