# I am a src_python[:session]{get_age()} {{{results(22)}}} year old undergraduate student studying computer science. Please don't expect much out of me; I am quite incompetent.

I am an undergraduate student studying computer science. Please don't expect much out of me; I am quite incompetent. 

I don't have anything set up for communication.

* Interests
I am mostly interested in graphics programming and programming language theory. I don't know much about those fields; I plan on posting my learning progress on this website. 

I am additionally interested in Japanese animation and culture. My favourite TV show is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
