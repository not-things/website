* Webhost 
I use [[https://nearlyfreespeech.net][NearlyFreeSpeech]] as my website host. Their non-production site pricing very cheap (0.01 USD per day). Probably, using Github pages is a better idea, but I didn't want to make an entirely new account just for a website.

* Publishing
I write my notes with ~org-mode~. The notes are exported to HTML and published with Rsync.

Here's the elisp code snippet.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
		'(("website" :base-directory "[directory]/website/org-files/"
		   :publishing-directory "[directory]/website/publish/"
		   :completion-function (lambda (property_list)
								  (interactive)
								  (async-shell-command "../publish.sh"))
		   :auto-sitemap t
		   :sitemap-title "nothing's inside sitemap")))
#+end_src
