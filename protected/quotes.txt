A goal is a dream with a deadline.
I did what I was supposed to. That's not fair.
How the past chews on your shoes, and these memories lick my ear...
If you focus on results, you will never change. If you focus on change, you will always get results.
I was ashamed of myself when I realized life was a costume party and I attended with my real face.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
Live, go outside and feel the sunlight caressing your skin, take a walk, dream, plan, work, learn, and enjoy the little moments because there are only so many of them.
Everything is just a temporary experience.
