#+TITLE: about me

You can call me /nothings/. Please don't expect much out of me. I am an idiot.

You might be wondering - why is this website even here? It's pretty barren, there's basically nothing to see here. To that, well, I don't disagree. I suppose the purpose this website is more to be a creative outlet for me. For me it's some place where I can play around and experiment with stuff, regardless of whether or not someone will look at it. As for /why/ I chose to put this on the web, and not in a private drawer somewhere? I suppose I get more motivation when there's an perceived audience that /can, but not necessarily will/ look at whatever slop that I make.
